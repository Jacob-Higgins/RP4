  abstract = {Analysis of the efficiency of two basic strategies for de/re-orbiting large space debris objects to disposal orbits (DO) is given. Large objects in LEO are classified into groups with similar orbital inclinations and comprise primarily last stages of launch vehicles, in GEO vicinity the paper studies upper stages. Under the first de/re-orbiting variant, it is assumed a spacecraft-collector is equipped with several thruster de/re-orbiting kits (TDKs); one of them can be fixed on an object and is capable of de/re-orbiting an object to a DO independently of the collector. In the second variant, a collector operates as a space tug: transfers objects to a DO and then returns to the next objects in line. The authors study possible configuration layouts of collectors in LEO and near GEO. The available analogous projects are analyzed. The efficiency of both de/re-orbiting variants can be properly compared using the estimations of collector's dry mass and having at one's disposal the parameters of the maneuvers required for transfers between all objects in the group. As reasonable criteria of effectiveness, one can consider (separately or jointly) the launch mass of an equipped collector, its {$\Delta$}V budget, and the required number of such active spacecraft. Two de/re-orbiting variants are compared in terms of these criteria via mass-energy diagrams constructed for each group of objects in both altitude regions. Analysis of these diagrams shows that low Earth orbits can be more efficiently cleaned under the first de-orbiting variant by using a two-stage space system consisting of an active spacecraft carrying TDKs. For GEO, it is expedient to choose the second re-orbiting variant using a single-stage spacecraft. Our analysis shows that LEO cleaning is an order of magnitude more expensive than that for GEO, hence the problem of LEO population should be given increased attention.},

  abstract = {According to all available findings at international level, the Kessler syndrome, increase of the number of space debris in Low Earth Orbits due to mutual collisions, appears now to be a fact, triggered mainly by several major break-ups in orbit which occurred since 2007. The time may have come to study how to clean this fundamentally useful orbital region in an active way. CNES has studied potential solutions for more than 12 years! The paper aims at reviewing the current status of these activities. The high level requirements are fundamental, and have to be properly justified. The working basis, as confirmed through IADC studies consists in the removal of 5--10 integer objects from the overcrowded orbits, spent upper stages or old satellites, as identified by NASA. The logic of CNES activities consider a stepped approach aiming at progressively gaining the required Technological Readiness Level on the features required for Active Debris Removal which have not yet been demonstrated in orbit. The rendezvous with a non-cooperative, un-prepared, tumbling debris is essential. Following maturation gained with Research and Technology programs, a set of small orbital demonstrators could enable a confidence high enough to perform a full end to end demonstration performing the de-orbiting of a large debris and paving the way for the development of a first generation operational de-orbiter. The internal CNES studies, led together by the Toulouse Space Centre and the Paris Launcher Directorate, have started in 2008 and led to a detailed System Requirements Document used for the Industrial studies. Three industrial teams did work under CNES contract during 2011, led by Thales Alenia Space, Bertin Technologies and Astrium Space Transportation, with numerous sub-contractors. Their approaches were very rich, complementary, and innovative. The second phase of studies began mid-2012. Some key questions nevertheless have to be resolved, and correspond generally to current IADC actions: The casualty risk associated to a ``passive'' de-orbitation is of paramount importance, major driver between passive and active re-entry, The residual movement of debris is crucial for the interfacing phase, whichever the solution is, The debris physical state in orbit is a major question, Some solutions increase the collision risk, but for a limited time period; we may not have yet the appropriate tools. The paper gives a status of where we stand, of the cooperation with the international partners, and raises the questions which remain open and have to be dealt with in the coming months.},

  abstract = {Active Debris Removal (ADR) is one of the current hot spots in space research. Plenty of engineering challenges, it deals with uncooperative and tumbling orbiting objects to be approached and captured autonomously by another space vehicle, to eventually change their dynamics either directly transferring them to a disposal orbit or providing a control device to be attached to the dead element to make it controlled up to disposal. Different techniques are being proposed in literature, starting from the classical robotic arm to grasp the target up to action-reaction principle exploitation with no contact at all, such as gas plume impinging on the object surfaces to change its momentum. In particular, the use of proximity blow effects of a chemical thruster can be exploited to intervene on the uncooperative object angular momentum to control its rotational dynamics and prepare it for capture. Chemical propulsion is a high TRL technology that would not require long development and validation plan for the proposed application. A key point for this technology to be effective stays in evaluating the actual energy transfer between the gas particles and the uncooperative object, and its sensitivity to the several parameters the scenario depends on. This paper discusses the numerical simulator implemented at Politecnico di Milano to assess the feasibility and performance of this attitude control strategy, and its sensitivity to the numerous parameters involved in its design, looking for criticalities, benefits and drivers. The physical mechanism of momentum transfer, at the base of the simulator, is described at first: the investigation of the momentum transfer mechanism requires the definition of a plume model and a plume impingement model to simulate the interaction with the debris surface. The effects of the impinging plume on the angular dynamics of the debris object are then presented. An application of the method to a study case is presented to show the effectiveness and the applicability of this method. The effects of the system physical characteristic on the dynamics are also discussed. It is demonstrated, through the above-mentioned simulator, how the concept of de-tumbling targets using gas plume impingement may be very attractive in future ADR missions: attitude control strategies can be found to fulfil the requirements of de-tumbling space debris with chemical engine to safer face the subsequent disposal phase.}

For impingement in the transitional-flow regime, a "bridging relation" applicable to shear flow is used to modify the impingement effect calculated for the free-molecule regime. Results are given for the Hughes 5-lbf thruster plume within the HS 376 cylindrical solar panel. Reasonable agreement of the calculated thrust loss is obtained with flight data from HS 376-class spacecraft. A prediction is also made for the plume of the highly viscous nozzle flow from a small electrothermal thruster.},

  abstract = {Numerical and experimental investigations of both far-field and near-field supersonic steady jet interactions with a flat surface at various atmospheric pressures are presented in this paper. These studies were done in assessing the landing hazards of both the NASA Mars Science Laboratory and Phoenix Mars spacecrafts. Temporal and spatial ground pressure measurements in conjunction with numerical solutions at altitudes of approx.35 nozzle exit diameters and jet expansion ratios (e) between 0.02 and 100 are used. Data from steady nitrogen jets are compared to both pulsed jets and rocket exhaust plumes at Mach approx.5. Due to engine cycling, overpressures and the plate shock dynamics are different between pulsed and steady supersonic impinging jets. In contrast to highly over-expanded (e {$<$}1) and underexpanded exhaust plumes, results show that there is a relative ground pressure load maximum for moderately underexpanded (e approx.2-5) jets which demonstrate a long collimated plume shock structure. For plumes with e much {$>$}5 (lunar atmospheric regime), the ground pressure is minimal due to the development of a highly expansive shock structure. We show this is dependent on the stability of the plate shock, the length of the supersonic core and plume decay due to shear layer instability which are all a function of the jet expansion ratio. Asymmetry and large gradients in the spatial ground pressure profile and large transient overpressures are predominantly linked to the dynamics of the plate shock. More importantly, this study shows that thruster plumes exhausting into martian environments possess the largest surface pressure loads and can occur at high spacecraft altitudes in contrast to the jet interactions at terrestrial and lunar atmospheres. Theoretical and analytical results also show that subscale supersonic cold gas jets adequately simulate the flow field and loads due to rocket plume impingement provided important scaling parameters are in agreement. These studies indicate the critical importance of testing and modeling plume-surface interactions for descent and ascent of spacecraft and launch vehicles.},

In the original ESA SysNova study, the COBRA concept was investigated as an active debris removal system, using contactless technology to deorbit a space debris object and to control its attitude. It was found that the concept is more effective for controlling the attitude of a debris object. An on-orbit experiment was proposed to have a chaser modify the attitude state of a space object in ESA's COBRA IRIDES project, which has now been canceled due to the lack of propellant in the chaser spacecraft.

  abstract = {Space debris is considered as a serious problem for operational space missions. Many enabling space debris capturing and removal methods have been proposed in the past decade and several methods have been tested on ground and/or in parabolic flight experiments. However, not a single space debris has been removed yet. A space debris object is usually non-cooperative and thus different with targets of on-orbit servicing missions. Thus, capturing and removal of space debris is significantly more challenging. One of the greatest challenges is how to reliably capture and remove a non-cooperative target avoiding to generate even more space debris. To motivate this research area and facilitate the development of active space debris removal, this paper provides review and comparison of the existing technologies on active space debris capturing and removal. It also reviews research areas worth investigating under each capturing and removal method. Frameworks of methods for capturing and removing space debris are developed. The advantages and drawbacks of the most relevant capturing and removal methods are addressed as well. In addition, examples and existing projects related to these methods are discussed.},

  abstract = {Soft landings on extra-terrestrial surfaces are vital for any sample return missions. Moreover, during landing on such bodies, dust impingement on the lander module and Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) systems can cause serious complications. To prevent system failures due to scoured regolith, and also minimize contamination of surface regolith for sample collection, the rocket can be used to decelerate the spacecraft to a vertical descent velocity from which it can freefall. A Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) technique is developed to investigate the interaction of rocket plume with surface regolith of an airless extra-terrestrial body. Continuum breaks down as the exhaust exits the engine nozzle, and the gases expand rapidly into the vacuum. Near the nozzle exit, the process enters a rarefied flow regime and an open-source DSMC code is developed to model the movement and collision stages of rarefied plume gas and dust particles. In this simulation, the collision occurs between gas particles of the rocket plume as it impinges on such an extra-terrestrial surface. The solver used for carried out this simulation is dsmcFOAM solver, a part of OpenFOAM. The surface properties such as pressure coefficient and heat flux are computed and analysed to observe the impact of plume impingement on extra-terrestrial regolith.},

  abstract = {Impingement of satellite thruster plume on the adjacent surfaces of the satellite generates disturbance torques and heat loads that are undesirable. It is therefore important to configure the spacecraft such that the impingement effects of the thruster plume are minimized. In the present work, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study of plume expansion in to low pressure environment is carried out, and the impact pressure and heat flux on the flat plate are determined. The simulations are carried out for the reported experimental conditions of plume impingent on a flat plate for various standoff distances of the plate from the nozzle. The Knudsen number distribution shows that the flow remains in continuum in the vicinity of the nozzle and at the impingement region on the plate. The results of the simulation are compared with the measured test data for model validation. Finally, the effect of incorporating temperature jump condition on the impingement heat flux estimation is presented. The CFD model predicts the peak pressure and heat flux within 1.6 and 11.9\% of the measured data.},

  abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of rocket plume impingement on flat surfaces is critical for designing effective and sustainable landing pads. The current near vacuum study measures the surface pressures and temperature profiles arising on a flat surface due to highly underexpanded, axisymmetric plume impingement. The experiments were conducted in a dedicated, large-volume plume-regolith facility situated at the University of Glasgow. A total of eight tests were conducted, comprising of both constant and pulsed firing modes. The impingement plate is located at stand-off distances equal to 4 and 16 times the nozzle exit diameters and plate inclinations of  0{$^\circ$} and  30{$^\circ$}. Reduced stand-off distance increases impingement pressure, with a transient peak in the early stages of impingement indicating the presence of a primary shock wave. Higher stand-off distance resulted in decreased impingement pressure without an initial peak, but with a spike at the end of impingement once the nozzle had stopped firing. For inclined plates, the centerline impingement pressure magnitude decreased by around 40\% compared with the  0{$^\circ$} inclination. The measured pressures at lower stand-off height are then compared with the results of both a two-way coupled direct simulation Monte Carlo/Navier--Stokes--Fourier solver and an analytical theory. The results from all methods are in good agreement with each other, with the simulation and experimental centerline pressures being within 1\% of each other. As the optical thickness of the gas is very low in the experimental case, the numerical method is used to generate a Schlieren image to analyze the shock structure.},
